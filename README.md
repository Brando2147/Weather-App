# Weather-App
 
## Description

For this assignment I created a weather dashboard app. To check the weather of the current day and also get the weekly forecast.

This app uses the moment.js library to get the current date and time.

This app also uses the open weather map API to retrieve weather data. To view more details about the API check out the website:
